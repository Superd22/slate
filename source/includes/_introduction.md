# Introduction

Spectrum is the official community platform for Star Citizen, it hosts the official forums & chats of the game, as well as numerous organisations'.

While no **official** API has ever been made available, Spectrum is built around a REST API that this site proposes to document.

Please note this is **unofficial** and **not supported** by either CIG or Turbulent. There is currently no way of interacting with the API besides using the credentials of an account you own, which means everything you do **MUST** remain in the TOS.
